# How it was made:
#### HTML5, CSS3, Javascript E6

# Optimizations
#### When an operation is pressed, it automatically calculates the selected numbers. 

# Lesson Learned: 
#### .value is a property that takes the numeric value from characters entered into a form. Once those numbers can be processed by Javascript, I used parseFloat to write the calculation equations for each operation.
